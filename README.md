# assemblytool
Placeholder assemblytool kernel for development of Riskeer

Withing Riskeer, functionality is being developed to support assambly of assessment results for the WBI2017. 
The supporting calculation kernel for this functionality is developed simultaneously. This code is intended to be used temporarily as a substitude for the final kernel. In this way also the visualization in Riskeer can be developed without having to finish the official calculation kernel. 

This code is not tested to a full extend. Also documentation is omitted (Except for the documentation of the code itself).
